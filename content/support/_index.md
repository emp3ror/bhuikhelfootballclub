The Bhuikhel Football Club are calling for your support as our **1ST GHODEJATRA 6A SIDE OPEN TOURNAMENT** is happening on 23rd to the 26th of Chaitra, 2080!

We have been dedicated to providing grassroots football development training to young players. Your support for this tournament helps us sustain and enhance our ongoing programs. We are proud to have offered **full scholarships to 60%** of our students, including those from lower-income families, girls, local kids, and many others who benefit from partial scholarships.

We are exploring various avenues to support the career development of young talents in sports. One initiative we're excited about is our **Growth food program**, designed to provide essential nutrients to talents in need. We believe that this program will not only benefit individual athletes but also contribute to creating opportunities across diverse fields nationally.

Your financial contribution, no matter the size, will play a crucial role in helping us fund to create a beautiful tournament! Every money you donate brings us one step closer to creating a lasting impact and transforming lives.

Your support is the lifeblood of our charity, help us in making a difference.

To contribute to our innovative cause, please get in touch with us either through our Facebook page [facebook.com/Bhuikhelfootballclub/](https://www.facebook.com/Bhuikhelfootballclub/) or directly with a designated contact person to make a donation. Please share this information with those around you as well.
